# Quest Design Philosophy

Quests in LureLands exist to advance the story, deepen character relationships, and reinforce the themes of legacy and restoration.

There are no filler quests.

Quests should never unlock biomes out of sequence.
Biome access must follow the progression defined in WORLD_MAP_AND_BIOMES.md.

## Core Principles

### 1. Every Quest Must Matter
Each quest must serve at least one purpose:
- Reveal character backstory
- Unlock new fishing mechanics or locations
- Restore part of the environment
- Advance the central mystery

### 2. No Pure Fetch Quests
If a quest involves collecting or delivering items, it must:
- Reveal new narrative information
- Permanently change the world or NPC behavior
- Unlock new progression

### 3. NPCs Are Story Carriers
NPCs do not exist to give tasks. Their quests reflect:
- Regret over what was lost
- Hope that things might improve
- Personal ties to fishing and the water

### 4. Personal Stakes First
Early quests focus on:
- Protecting the family home
- Helping familiar faces
- Repairing things that once worked

The player is rediscovering the town, not discovering it for the first time.

## Fishing as Narrative

Fishing-related quests may require:
- Fishing at specific times of day
- Fishing during certain weather or seasons
- Catching species tied to memories or locations

Fishing itself is a storytelling tool.

## Quest Outcomes

Completing quests may:
- Permanently change NPC dialogue
- Unlock new areas or fishing spots
- Reveal journal fragments or memories
- Improve fishing conditions
- Progress the story subtly

Quests should leave the player feeling that something meaningful has shifted.
