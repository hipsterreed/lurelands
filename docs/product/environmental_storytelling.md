# Environmental Storytelling

The world of LureLands tells its story through space, sound, and interaction.

## World State Reflects Progress

As the player advances:
- Water becomes clearer and more active
- Fish become more visible and varied
- Docks and paths feel used again
- Ambient sounds grow livelier

The world responds to care, not power.

## Storytelling Through Space

Environmental clues include:
- Broken docks and abandoned boats
- Old fishing markers near water
- Weathered signs and forgotten tools
- Ruins that feel purposeful, not random

Nothing exists without narrative intent.

## Family History in the Environment

The player’s home reflects generational use:
- Old fishing gear stored away
- Past repairs visible in walls and floors
- Items hinting at better days

The house is not a starter hut — it is history.

## Fishing as Environmental Feedback

Fishing success mirrors the world’s state:
- Early game: quiet, sparse waters
- Mid game: returning life and variation
- Late game: abundance and balance
