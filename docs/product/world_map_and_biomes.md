# World Map & Biome Progression

The world of LureLands is designed to open gradually through restoration, trust, and understanding rather than combat or leveling.

Biomes are unlocked in a deliberate order to support narrative escalation, mechanical depth, and player comfort.

1. Starter Biome — Town & Greenlands  
2. Ocean & Coast  
3. Desert
