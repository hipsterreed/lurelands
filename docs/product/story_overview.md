# LureLands — Story Overview

LureLands is a cozy, fishing-driven game about legacy, restoration, and holding onto what still matters.

The player lives in a quiet coastal town where their family has remained for generations. Their house—once supported by the rhythm of fishing and the life of the water—has slowly fallen into disrepair as the town faded. With fishing in decline and work growing scarce, the property has accrued an unpaid lien, threatening the last piece of the player’s family legacy.

Rather than leaving, the player chooses to stay.

Fishing becomes both a means of survival and a reconnection to the town’s past. As the player sells fish, pays down the lien, and restores forgotten places, they begin to uncover the story of a legendary fisherman who once defined life in the town. His disappearance marked the slow loss of fish, confidence, and identity.

The story of LureLands unfolds quietly through play. NPCs share fragmented memories, quests reveal personal histories, and the environment reflects the changing state of the waters. Fishing is not just a mechanic—it is the language through which the world responds.

At its core, LureLands is about patience, care, and choosing to stay when it would be easier to leave.
