# Player Progression & Engagement

Player engagement in LureLands is driven by layered progression, emotional payoff, and steady discovery.

## Core Progression Loop

Fish → Sell → Pay Lien → Unlock → Discover → Repeat

This loop supports:
- Narrative advancement
- Mechanical growth
- Environmental change

---

## Secondary Progression Loops

- NPC trust → deeper quests → story reveals
- Area restoration → new fish → new lore
- Equipment upgrades → access to forgotten waters

Each loop reinforces the others.

## Maintaining Engagement

The game keeps players engaged by:
- Introducing mysteries before resolving old ones
- Allowing flexible pacing with no hard deadlines
- Rewarding curiosity with narrative payoff
- Avoiding punishment for slow progress

There is always something just beyond reach.

## Endgame Philosophy

The end of the main story is not the end of play:
- The world remains active
- Fishing remains meaningful
- NPCs continue to react to progress

LureLands ends with belonging, not completion.
