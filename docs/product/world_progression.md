# World Progression Systems

LureLands uses dual progression systems to provide both practical and narrative-driven goals.

Rune placement unlocks biomes in the canonical order defined in WORLD_MAP_AND_BIOMES.md.

---

## The Lien — Stability Progression

The lien represents the player’s obligation to protect their family home.

- Progress is numerical and visible
- Paid through selling fish and completing work
- Unlocks upgrades, repairs, and story beats
- NPC dialogue changes as progress is made

The lien provides urgency without pressure.

## The Lost Runes — World Progression

Lost Runes are ancient markers tied to the balance of the waters.

- Discovered through exploration, fishing, and quests
- Each rune corresponds to a sealed region
- Runes must be placed in specific locations
- Placing a rune unlocks new areas and fishing zones

Runes represent knowledge and connection, not power.

---

## Rune Discovery Rules

- Runes are never random drops
- Each rune has narrative context
- NPCs often hint at their existence before discovery
- Legendary fish may guard rune locations

---

## Visual Progress Tracking

Players can always see:
- Lien progress via ledger or UI meter
- Rune progress via map markers and empty slots
- Locked areas that hint at future exploration

Progress should feel planned, not accidental.

---

## Narrative Integration

The lien keeps the player grounded.
The runes pull the player deeper into the world.

Both systems advance the story without relying on urgency or combat.
